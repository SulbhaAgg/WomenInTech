# fundIt
A platform that democratizes access to capital for small businesses via crowdfunding

## Inspiration
All starts ups don't make million dollars in their beginning years of their business for rich people to invest in them but they need money to grow. Startups don't have huge connections and profits to get funding. <br>
Meanwhile, most people are not as rich but want to invest. So we want to build a platform that benefits small Businesses and Investors both. Startups put their video pitches for the help make investor a decision on the startup and investor can make an appointment with the business to know about their future goals and before investing. 

## What it does
